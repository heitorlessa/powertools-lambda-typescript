title: Logger
description: Core utility
---

Logger provides an opinionated logger with output structured as JSON.

## Key features

* Capturing key fields from the Lambda context, cold starts, and structure logging output as JSON.
* Logging Lambda invocation events when instructed (disabled by default).
* Printing all the logs only for a percentage of invocations via log sampling (disabled by default).
* Appending additional keys to structured logs at any point in time.
* Providing a custom log formatter (Bring Your Own Formatter) to output logs in a structure compatible with your organizationâ€™s Logging RFC.

## Getting started

### Installation

Install the library in your project:

```shell
npm install @aws-lambda-powertools/logger
```

### Usage

The `Logger` utility must always be instantiated outside the Lambda handler. By doing this, subsequent invocations processed by the same instance of your function can reuse these resources. This saves cost by reducing function run time. In addition, `Logger` can keep track of a cold start and inject the appropriate fields into logs.

=== "handler.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1 3"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/basicUsage.ts"
    ```

### Utility settings

The library requires two settings. You can set them as environment variables, or pass them in the constructor.

These settings will be used across all logs emitted:

| Setting                | Description                                                                                                      | Environment variable            | Default Value       | Allowed Values                             | Example Value       | Constructor parameter |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Service name**       | Sets the name of service of which the Lambda function is part of, that will be present across all log statements | `POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME`       | `service_undefined` | Any string                                 | `serverlessAirline` | `serviceName`         |
| **Logging level**      | Sets how verbose Logger should be, from the most verbose to the least verbose (no logs)                          | `LOG_LEVEL`                     | `info`              | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `SILENT` | `ERROR`             | `logLevel`            |
| **Log incoming event** | Whether to log or not the incoming event when using the decorator or middleware                                  | `POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_LOG_EVENT`   | `false`             | `true`, `false`                            | `false`             | `logEvent`            |
| **Debug log sampling** | Probability that a Lambda invocation will print all the log items regardless of the log level setting            | `POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_SAMPLE_RATE` | `0`                 | `0.0` to `1`                               | `0.5`               | `sampleRateValue`     |

#### Example using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)

=== "handler.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="1 4"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/sam.ts"
    ```

=== "template.yaml"

    ```yaml hl_lines="8 9"
    Resources:
      ShoppingCartApiFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
          Runtime: nodejs18.x
          Environment:

              LOG_LEVEL: WARN
              POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME: serverlessAirline
    ```

### Standard structured keys

Your Logger will include the following keys to your structured logging (default log formatter):

| Key                         | Example                                                                                                          | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **message**: `string`       | `Query performed to DynamoDB`                                                                                    | A descriptive, human-readable representation of this log item                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **sampling_rate**: `float`  | `0.1`                                                                                                            | When enabled, it prints all the logs of a percentage of invocations, e.g. 10%                                                                                                                                                   |
| **service**: `string`       | `serverlessAirline`                                                                                              | A unique name identifier of the service this Lambda function belongs to, by default `service_undefined`                                                                                                                         |

This value is always presented in Lambda environment, whether [tracing is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/services-xray.html){target="_blank"} or not. Logger will always log this value. |
| **error**: `Object`         | `{ name: "Error", location: "/my-project/handler.ts:18", message: "Unexpected error #1", stack: "[stacktrace]"}` | Optional - An object containing information about the Error passed to the logger                                                                                                                                                |

???+ info
    When `POWERTOOLS_DEV` environment variable is present and set to `"true"` or `"1"`, Logger will pretty-print log messages for easier readability. We recommend to use this setting only when debugging on local environments.

### Capturing Lambda context info

You can enrich your structured logs with key Lambda context information in multiple ways.

This functionality will include the following keys in your structured logs:

| Key                                | Example                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **cold_start**: `bool`             | `false`                                                                                  |
| **function_name** `string`         | `shopping-cart-api-lambda-prod-eu-west-1`                                                |
| **function_memory_size**: `number` | `128`                                                                                    |
| **function_arn**: `string`         | `arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:123456789012:function:shopping-cart-api-lambda-prod-eu-west-1` |
| **function_request_id**: `string`  | `c6af9ac6-7b61-11e6-9a41-93e812345678`                                                   |

=== "Middy Middleware"

    !!! tip "A note about Middy"
        Currently we support only Middy `v3.x` that you can install it by running `npm i @middy/core@~3`.
        Check their docs to learn more about [Middy and its middleware stack](https://middy.js.org/docs/intro/getting-started){target="_blank"} as well as [best practices when working with Powertools](https://middy.js.org/docs/integrations/lambda-powertools#best-practices){target="_blank"}.

    ```typescript hl_lines="1 13"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/middy.ts"
    ```

=== "Decorator"

    !!! note
        The class method decorators in this project follow the experimental implementation enabled via the [`experimentalDecorators` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#experimentalDecorators) in TypeScript. Additionally, they are implemented in a way that fits asynchronous methods. When decorating a synchronous method, the decorator replaces its implementation with an asynchronous one causing the caller to have to `await` the now decorated method.
        If this is not the desired behavior, you can call the `logger.injectLambdaContext()` method directly in your handler.

    ```typescript hl_lines="8"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/decorator.ts"
    ```

    1. Binding your handler method allows your handler to access `this` within the class methods.

=== "Manual"

    ```typescript hl_lines="6"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/manual.ts"
    ```

In each case, the printed log will look like this:

=== "Example CloudWatch Logs excerpt"

    ```json hl_lines="2-6"
    {
        "cold_start": true,
        "function_arn": "arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:123456789012:function:shopping-cart-api-lambda-prod-eu-west-1",
        "function_memory_size": 128,
        "function_request_id": "c6af9ac6-7b61-11e6-9a41-93e812345678",
        "function_name": "shopping-cart-api-lambda-prod-eu-west-1",
        "level": "INFO",

        "xray_trace_id": "abcdef123456abcdef123456abcdef123456"
    }
    ```

#### Log incoming event

When debugging in non-production environments, you can instruct Logger to log the incoming event with the middleware/decorator parameter `logEvent` or via `POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_LOG_EVENT` env var set to `true`.

???+ warning
	This is disabled by default to prevent sensitive info being logged

=== "Decorator"

    ```typescript hl_lines="8"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/eventDecorator.ts"
    ```

    1. Binding your handler method allows your handler to access `this` within the class methods.

### Appending persistent additional log keys and values

You can append additional persistent keys and values in the logs generated during a Lambda invocation using either mechanism:

* Via the Logger's `appendKeys` method, for all log items generated after calling this method
* Passing them in the Logger's constructor

To remove the keys you added, you can use the `removeKeys` method.

        }
    }
    ```


!!! tip "Logger will automatically ignore any key with an `undefined` value"

#### Clearing all state

The Logger utility is commonly initialized in the global scope, outside the handler function.
When you attach persistent log attributes through the `persistentLogAttributes` constructor option or via the `appendKeys`, `addPersistentLogAttributes` methods, this data is attached to the Logger instance.  

Due to the [Lambda Execution Context reuse](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html), this means those persistent log attributes may be reused across invocations.
If you want to make sure that persistent attributes added **inside the handler function** code are not persisted across invocations, you can set the parameter `clearState` as `true`  in the `injectLambdaContext` middleware or decorator.

=== "Middy Middleware"

    ```typescript hl_lines="30"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/clearStateMiddy.ts"
    ```

=== "Decorator"

    ```typescript hl_lines="16"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/clearStateDecorator.ts"
    ```

    1. Binding your handler method allows your handler to access `this` within the class methods.

In each case, the printed log will look like this:

=== "First invocation"

    ```json hl_lines="2 4-7"
    {
        "biz": "baz",
        "cold_start": true,

    }
    ```


### Appending additional data to a single log item

You can append additional data to a single log item by passing objects as additional parameters.

* Pass a simple string for logging it with default key name `extra`
* Pass one or multiple objects containing arbitrary data to be logged. Each data object should be placed in an enclosing object as a single property value, you can name this property as you need: `{ myData: arbitraryObjectToLog }`
* If you already have an object containing a `message` key and an additional property, you can pass this object directly

### Logging errors

You can log errors by using the `error` method and pass the error object as parameter.
The error will be logged with default key name `error`, but you can also pass your own custom key name.

!!! tip "Logging errors and log level"
    You can also log errors using the `warn`, `info`, and `debug` methods. Be aware of the log level though, you might miss those  errors when analyzing the log later depending on the log level configuration.


## Advanced

### Log levels

The default log level is `INFO` and can be set using the `logLevel` constructor option or by using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.

Logger supports the following log levels:

| Level      | Numeric value |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `DEBUG`    | 8             |
| `INFO`     | 12            |
| `WARN`     | 16            |
| `ERROR`    | 20            |
| `CRITICAL` | 24            |
| `SILENT`   | 28            |

You can access the current log level by using the `getLevelName()` method. This method returns the name of the current log level as a string. If you want to change the log level at runtime, you can use the `setLogLevel()` method. This method accepts a string value that represents the log level you want to set, both lower and upper case values are supported.

```typescript
--8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/logLevel.ts"
```

If you want to access the numeric value of the current log level, you can use the `level` property. For example, if the current log level is `INFO`, `logger.level` property will return `12`.

#### Silencing logs

The `SILENT` log level provides a simple and efficient way to suppress all log messages without the need to modify your code. When you set this log level, all log messages, regardless of their severity, will be silenced.

This feature is useful when you want to have your code instrumented to produce logs, but due to some requirement or business decision, you prefer to not emit them.

By setting the log level to `SILENT`, which can be done either through the `logLevel` constructor option or by using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, you can easily suppress all logs as needed.

!!! note
    Use the `SILENT` log level with care, as it can make it more challenging to monitor and debug your application. Therefore, we advise using this log level judiciously.

### Using multiple Logger instances across your code

The `createChild` method allows you to create a child instance of the Logger, which inherits all of the attributes from its parent. You have the option to override any of the settings and attributes from the parent logger, including [its settings](#utility-settings), any [persistent attributes](#appending-persistent-additional-log-keys-and-values), and [the log formatter](#custom-log-formatter-bring-your-own-formatter). Once a child logger is created, the logger and its parent will act as separate instances of the Logger class, and as such any change to one won't be applied to the other. 

 The following example shows how to create multiple Loggers that share service name and persistent attributes while specifying different logging levels within a single Lambda invocation. As the result, only ERROR logs with all the inherited attributes will be displayed in CloudWatch Logs from the child logger, but all logs emitted will have the same service name and persistent attributes.

    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/createChild.ts"
    ```

    ```json hl_lines="21"
    {
        "level": "INFO",

        "timestamp": "2021-12-12T22:32:54.667Z",

        "xray_trace_id": "abcdef123456abcdef123456abcdef123456"
    }
    {

    }
    {
        "level": "ERROR",

        "service": "serverlessAirline",
        "timestamp": "2021-12-12T22:32:54.670Z",
        "aws_account_id":"123456789012",
        "aws_region":"eu-west-1",
        "xray_trace_id": "abcdef123456abcdef123456abcdef123456"
    }
    ```

### Sampling logs

Use sampling when you want to print all the log items generated in your code, based on a **percentage of your concurrent/cold start invocations**.

You can do that by setting a "sample rate", a float value ranging from `0.0` (0%) to `1` (100%), by using a `POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_SAMPLE_RATE` env var or passing the `sampleRateValue` parameter in the Logger constructor.
This number represents the probability that a Lambda invocation will print all the log items regardless of the log level setting.

For example, by setting the "sample rate" to `0.5`, roughly 50% of your lambda invocations will print all the log items, including the `debug` ones.

!!! tip "When is this useful?"
    In production, to avoid log data pollution and reduce CloudWatch costs, developers are encouraged to use the logger with `logLevel` equal to `ERROR` or `WARN`.
    This means that only errors or warnings will be printed.

    However, it might still be useful to print all the logs (including debug ones) of a very small percentage of invocations to have a better understanding of the behaviour of your code in production even when there are no errors.
    
    **Sampling decision happens at the Logger initialization**. This means sampling may happen significantly more or less than depending on your traffic patterns, for example a steady low number of invocations and thus few cold starts.
    If you want to reset the sampling decision and refresh it for each invocation, you can call the `logger.refreshSampleRateCalculation()` method at the beginning or end of your handler.

### Custom Log formatter (Bring Your Own Formatter)

You can customize the structure (keys and values) of your log items by passing a custom log formatter, an object that implements the `LogFormatter` abstract class.

=== "handler.ts"

    ```typescript hl_lines="2 5"
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/bringYourOwnFormatterHandler.ts"
    ```

This is how the `MyCompanyLogFormatter` (dummy name) would look like:

=== "utils/formatters/MyCompanyLogFormatter.ts"

    ```typescript
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/bringYourOwnFormatterClass.ts"
    ```

This is how the printed log would look:

=== "Example CloudWatch Logs excerpt"

    ```json
    {
        "message": "This is an INFO log",
        "service": "serverlessAirline",
        "awsRegion": "eu-west-1",
        "correlationIds": {
            "awsRequestId": "c6af9ac6-7b61-11e6-9a41-93e812345678",
            "xRayTraceId": "abcdef123456abcdef123456abcdef123456",
            "myCustomCorrelationId": "foo-bar-baz"
        },
        "lambdaFunction": {
            "name": "shopping-cart-api-lambda-prod-eu-west-1",
            "arn": "arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:123456789012:function:shopping-cart-api-lambda-prod-eu-west-1",
            "memoryLimitInMB": 128,
            "version": "$LATEST",
            "coldStart": true
        },
        "logLevel": "INFO",
        "timestamp": "2021-12-12T23:13:53.404Z",
        "logger": {
            "sampleRateValue": "0.5",
            "name": "aws-lambda-powertools-typescript",
            "version": "0.0.1"
        },
        "awsAccountId": "123456789012"
    }
    ```

!!! tip "Custom Log formatter and Child loggers"
    It is not necessary to pass the `LogFormatter` each time a [child logger](#using-multiple-logger-instances-across-your-code) is created. The parent's LogFormatter will be inherited by the child logger.

## Testing your code

### Inject Lambda Context

When unit testing your code that makes use of `logger.addContext()` or `injectLambdaContext` middleware and decorator, you can optionally pass a dummy Lambda Context if you want your logs to contain this information.

This is a Jest sample that provides the minimum information necessary for Logger to inject context data:

=== "handler.test.ts"

    ```typescript
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/logger/unitTesting.ts"
    ```

!!! tip
    If you don't want to declare your own dummy Lambda Context, you can use [`ContextExamples.helloworldContext`](https://github.com/aws-powertools/powertools-lambda-typescript/blob/main/packages/commons/src/samples/resources/contexts/hello-world.ts#L3-L16) from [`@aws-lambda-powertools/commons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-lambda-powertools/commons).

### Suppress logs with Jest

When unit testing your code with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) you can use the `POWERTOOLS_DEV` environment variable in conjunction with the Jest `--silent` CLI option to suppress logs from Logger.

```bash title="Disabling logs while testing with Jest"
export POWERTOOLS_DEV=true && npx jest --silent
```
